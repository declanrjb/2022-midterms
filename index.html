            <p class="light">PACs — <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/2022">Political Action Committees</a> — are organizations that raise and spend money in support of candidates. 
              Most PACs represent corporations, labor unions, or political interests, and an organization's PAC can solicit money from its members and then make donations in the name of the PAC.

        <p class="left-align light">Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/charles-e-schumer/summary?cid=N00001093&cycle=CAREER">Chuck Schumer</a>, for example, received a total of $2,062,884 from his top ten donors in the last election cycle. </p>
        <p class="left-align light">While the 1971 <a href="https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/contribution-limits/">Federal Election Campaign Act</a> 
          forbids PACs from donating more than $5000 to any candidate in a single election cycle, an organization's employees or other 
          associated individuals are free to give up to $2900 of their own money per candidate per election. At large organizations with thousands
          of members, these amounts can add up quickly. It is important to note, however, that such donation clusters do not necessarily 
          imply organization. According to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/include/contribmethod_pop.php">Open Secrets</a>: </p>
          <blockquote>
            "Of course, it is impossible to know either the economic interest that made each individual contribution possible or the motivation for each individual giver. However, the patterns of contributions provide critical information for voters, researchers and others. That is why Congress mandated that candidates and political parties request employer information from contributors and publicly report it when the contributor provides it.

            In some cases, a cluster of contributions from the same organization may indicate a concerted effort by that organization to "bundle" contributions to the candidate. In other cases—both with private companies and with government agencies, non-profits and educational institutions—the reason for the contributions may be completely unrelated to the organization.
            
            Showing these clusters of contributions from people associated with particular organizations provides a valuable—and unique—way of understanding where a candidate is getting his or her financial support. Knowing those groups is also useful after the election, as issues come before Congress and the administration that may affect those organizations and their industries."
